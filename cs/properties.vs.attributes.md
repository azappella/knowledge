# properties vs attributes

1. Attribute is a quality or object that **we attribute** to someone or something. For example, the scepter is an attribute of power and statehood. Usually, but not always, subjective. 
2. Property is a quality that **exists without any attribution**. For example, clay has adhesive qualities; i.e, a property of clay is its adhesive quality. Another example: one of the properties of metals is electrical conductivity. Properties demonstrate themselves through physical phenomena without the need to attribute them to someone or
something. By the same token, saying that someone has masculine attributes is self-evident. In effect, you could say that a property is owned by someone or something. Usually, but not always, objective. 

The distinction is not essential in Computer Science and these terms can usually be used interchangeably.
