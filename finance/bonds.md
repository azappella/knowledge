## characteristics of bonds

- **Face value** is the money amount the bond will be worth at maturity; it is also the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments. For example, say an investor purchases a bond at a premium $1,090 and another investor buys the same bond later when it is trading at a discount for $980. When the bond matures, both investors will receive the $1,000 face value of the bond.
- **The coupon rate** is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage. For example, a 5% coupon rate means that bondholders will receive 5% x $1000 face value = $50 every year.
- **Coupon dates** are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Payments can be made in any interval, but the standard is semiannual payments.
- **The maturity** date is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.
- **The issue price** is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds.

Credit quality and time to maturity are the principal factors that determine a bond's coupon rate.
