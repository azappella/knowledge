Andrew Zappella

I build things for the web.

At the crossroads between product design & development, I like to solve business problems while creating enjoyable experiences.

Co-founded Suisseo (2009), base7booking (2012, sold to trivago in 2016), and currently a managing partner at Lightstreams (2018).

I am an entrepreneur/designer/coder interested in Philosophy/Economics/Blockchain.
