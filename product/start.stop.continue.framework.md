# start, stop, continue framework

1. Start: What should you start doing?

These are activities and behaviors to improve processes, reduce waste, and positively impact the way the team functions. Think about technical and behavior elements that might fall into this category.

What tools should you start using? Is there a communication style that might work better for your team? 

- “What are the obvious gaps our business needs to fill?”
- “How would you do this?”
- “If you were in charge of scaling this organization, what would be your next move?”
- “What opportunities do you see our company currently missing out on?”

2. Stop: What should you stop doing?

These activities and behaviors are inefficient, wasteful, or have a negative impact on the way the team functions. Again, it’s important to consider both technical, behavioral, and organizational elements.

Is your team using a tool that doesn’t work for you? Is there a meeting style or a communication method that isn’t working?

- “What is hurting the company?”
- “What is the top error you notice the business making time and time again?”
- “If you had to eliminate one company initiative, what would it be and why?”
- “What is one thing the business focuses on heavily, but doesn’t produce a large ROI?”

3. Continue: What should you keep doing?

These are activities and behaviors that you’ve tried out and liked but that isn’t yet part of your core processes. Take stock of the tools and methods you’ve experimented with since the last review cycle.

- “What actions are we taking that have proven to be successful?”
- “Where are we most valuable?”
- “What can we not afford to lose?”
- “If we were to throw a party, what would it be for?”
- “Who do you want to celebrate, and why?”
