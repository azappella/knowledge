# segmentation

Industry segmentation is the process of dividing a market into smaller groups based on common characteristics. There are many different ways to segment an industry, but the most common methods are by sector, by customer type, and by geography.

Sector: The first way to segment an industry is by sector. Industries can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. The primary sector includes agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining. The secondary sector includes manufacturing and construction. The tertiary sector includes service industries such as retail, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

Customer Type: Another way to segment an industry is by customer type. This can be done by dividing customers into business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B). B2C industries sell products or services to individual consumers. B2B industries sell products or services to other businesses.

Geography: The last way to segment an industry is by geography. This can be done by dividing the market into local, national, and international markets. Local markets are small and only include businesses in a specific city or region. National markets are larger and include businesses from all over the country. International markets include businesses from all over the world.
