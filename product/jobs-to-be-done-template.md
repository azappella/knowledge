### Ask yourself the following questions: 

- What pain points do my customers have in common? 
- What do they currently lack?

### Determine customers’ desired outcomes. 

Without reference to your products or solutions you currently provide, complete the following phrases as though you were the customer: 
 
- Help me do ________.

You may find it helpful to ask customers and prospects to complete these phrases so that you can gather a variety of jobs to be done insights.
