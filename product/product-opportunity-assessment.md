# product opportunity assessment

1. Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)
2. For whom do we solve that problem? (target market)
3. How big is the opportunity? (market size)
4. How will we measure success? (metrics/revenue strategy)
5. What alternatives are out there now? (competitive landscape)
6. Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator)
7. Why now? (market window)
8. How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy)
9. What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements)
10. Given the above, what's the recommendation? (go or no go)

None of the questions speak to the actual solution. This is both intentional and critically important. 
The opportunity assessment should just discuss the problem to be solved, not the particular solution you have in mind.
