Discovered and read about aeroponic systems, which grow plants and vegetables without the need for soil. They use a nutrient-rich mist distributed to the roots via a pre-programmed mister.  https://www.greenmatters.com/p/aeroponic-farming

One of the disadvantages is that the seeds for the plants grown in aeroponic systems still need to germinate and sprout in a growing medium before being transferred.
