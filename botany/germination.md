## Germination vs sprouting

germination is the process by which an organism grows from a seed or similar structure while sprouting is the process  by which seeds are induced to sprout or germinate for commercial  purposes.

A seed is a biological structure that is encased in a protective outer covering.

Seeds consist of an embryo that later develops into a seedling through germination.

Germination is when the seed develops into a new plant when it meets certain required factors to end the dormancy period.

Germination is only achieved in seeds that contain an embryo.

Germination leads to the development of a seed into a seedling, which then develops into two structures: a plumule and a radicle.

Sprouting is a process by which seeds are soaked and developed into digestible forms to be used as food sources.
