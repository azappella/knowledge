I quickly was reviewing different options for a web-based markdown editor.

Some of the things I was looking for:

- Open source
- Web-based
- Workspaces
- Sync with Dropbox/Google Drive

## Web-based markdown editors
- https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/
- https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/
- https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html
- https://github.com/Laverna/laverna

## Desktop-based markdown editor
- https://github.com/fabiospampinato/notable

## Hybrid
- Typora
- Notion.so

Interestingly, the best tools that I have found are the hybrids.
