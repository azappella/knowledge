# Daily notes - 20190204

Today I had the realization that IPFS is *really* slow, but [it might just be IPNS](https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/why-ipns-is-so-slow/2161) or [something else](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3860). I need to run some tests at some point. 

While browsing, I discovered [peerpad](https://peerpad.net), which uses IPFS and which does not seem usable at all at the moment. It might just be related to my setup or browser settings. I checked the company that developed it, called [Siderus](https://siderus.io/). I also went further down the rabbit hole and found the project [orion](https://orion.siderus.io/#/) and its [repository](https://gitlab.com/siderus/orion). This project seems to be an IPFS web desktop app. I tried it but was completely underwhelmed. I think it is because of my expectations that IPFS should truly work like a *real* filesystem and that once I add a folder e.g. it should keep in sync. What we need is a way to sync files between an IPFS node and the local filesystem (i.e. exactly like dropbox/gdrive). 

Finally, checked out IPFS shipyard and followed that trail to see what the people were doing for IPFS ecosystem, ended up watching a dev meetup where someone introduced iim, a version manager for IPFS.
